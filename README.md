# With this method, the switch does not burn any fuses during the Firmware update, which means you can always downgrade

- Follow this Guide, these are easy steps!

# Updating your emuMMC with Daybreak

- 1: Download my last Releases
- 2: unpack the Firmware with winrar or 7zip

- 4: Put your memory card back into your Switch and start your console with the fusee.bin payload
- 5: Once booted, hold R while launching a game to boot into the homebrew menu.

- 7: Select the Firmware from your root directory.
- 8: Tap on Continue and then Preserve settings.
-    If you see the message Warning: exFAT firmware is missing or corrupt, you likely don't have the exFAT driver
-    installed on your sysMMC. Just press continue if this is the case.
- 9: If it is available choose Install (FAT32 + exFAT), otherwise Install (FAT32) and then Continue.
- 10: Wait until Daybreak completes installing the dumped firmware
- 11: Once it completes, it will ask if you want to reboot. Tap Reboot.
- 12: Once rebooted, launch into emuMMC and verify your system works. You can verify your system has been properly updated in Settings -> System.

 # WHAT IS SYSMMC / EMUMMC / STOCK
- STOCK is OFW. It is the actual factory firmware that comes from the factory
- SYSMMC is OFW with patches or CFW. You can run homebrews on. It piracy is not supported, buy the games reflects the OFW/STOCK itself.
- EMUMMC is the emulated SYSMMC. It copied itself from the OFW and placed 
inside the micro SD card, and it is always in the CFW method. It is 
unrelated to the STOCK/OFW/SYSMMC as it is a different entity after 
creation.

## Note: In order to keep Emummc permanently offline you should update it with daybreak with my last releases. I would only update via the Internet in Sysmmc!
