## WHAT IS SYSMMC / EMUMMC / STOCK
- STOCK is OFW. It is the actual factory firmware that comes from the factory
- SYSMMC is OFW with patches or CFW. You can run homebrews on it but do not install game backups on this
  world unless you know what you are doing and its consequences. It reflects the OFW/STOCK itself.
- EMUMMC is the emulated SYSMMC. It copied itself from the OFW and placed 
inside the micro SD card, and it is always in the CFW method. It is 
unrelated to the STOCK/OFW/SYSMMC as it is a different entity after 
creation. You can install and run anything here, like game backups, 
homebrews, etc.

## Note: In order to keep Emummc permanently offline you should update it with daybreak with my last releases. I would only update via the Internet in Sysmmc!
