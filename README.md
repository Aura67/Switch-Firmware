# Updating your emuMMC with Daybreak

- 1: Download my last Releases
- 2: unpack the Firmware with winrar or 7zip
- 3: Copy the entire contents into your root directory of your memory card
- 4: Put your memory card back into your Switch and start your console with the fusee.bin payload
- 5: Once booted, hold R while launching a game to boot into the homebrew menu.
- 6: Find Daybreak in the homebrew menu and launch it.
- 7: Select the Firmware from your root directory.
- 8: Tap on Continue and then Preserve settings.
-    If you see the message Warning: exFAT firmware is missing or corrupt, you likely don't have the exFAT driver
-    installed on your sysMMC. Just press continue if this is the case.
- 8: If it is available choose Install (FAT32 + exFAT), otherwise Install (FAT32) and then Continue.
- 10: Wait until Daybreak completes installing the dumped firmware
- 11: Once it completes, it will ask if you want to reboot. Tap Reboot.
- 12: Once rebooted, launch into emuMMC and verify your system works. You can verify your system has been properly updated in Settings -> System.
- 13: Enjoy.

## WHAT IS SYSMMC / EMUMMC / STOCK
- STOCK is OFW. It is the actual factory firmware that comes from the factory
- SYSMMC is OFW with patches or CFW. You can run homebrews on it but do not install game backups on this
  world unless you know what you are doing and its consequences. It reflects the OFW/STOCK itself.
- EMUMMC is the emulated SYSMMC. It copied itself from the OFW and placed 
inside the micro SD card, and it is always in the CFW method. It is 
unrelated to the STOCK/OFW/SYSMMC as it is a different entity after 
creation. You can install and run anything here, like game backups, 
homebrews, etc.

## Note: In order to keep Emummc permanently offline you should update it with daybreak with my last releases. I would only update via the Internet in Sysmmc!
